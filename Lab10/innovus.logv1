[03/20 13:37:11     33s] **WARN: (IMPOGDS-1176):	There are 26 empty cells. Check innovus.log# for the details.
[03/20 13:37:11     33s]   It is probably because your mapping file does not contain corresponding rules.
[03/20 13:37:11     33s]   Use default mapping file(without option -mapFile) to output all information of a cell.
